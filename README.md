# [Project 1: DonorsChoose.Org -Predict whether teachers' project proposals are accepted](https://github.com/sandeep-raychaudhuri/Predict-Approval-of-Project-Proposals-on-DonorsChoose.git)
**Type of Machine Learning Problem**- Projects Approval can be classified into 2 categories Approved (label 1) and not approved (label 0). Hence this is a **binary class classification Problem**. Since one of the columns is a Text Data we will use Vectorization to convert them into numeric format
**Performance Metric*** AUC Score,F1 Score,Confusion Matrix
 **Methods Used:**
 1. Vectorization using TFIDF, TFIDF Word 2 Vector
 2. OneHotEncoding
 3. Hyperparameter Tuning & Evaluation
 4. Decision Tree Classifer
