## Case Study: Predict Project Approval using Machine Learning and NLP (https://github.com/sandeep-raychaudhuri/Predict-Approval-of-Project-Proposals-on-DonorsChoose.git)

**Why:**  To determine the future value of a stock or a financial instrument traded (publicly) on an exchange to gain significant profit or avoid losses given efficient-market hypothesis. Although exact price prediction is nearly impossible, but approximaPrte price estimation is possible and can positively impact investor's buying strategy.<br><br>

 **How:** Based on 5 year historical data from DonorsChoose.org using TFIDF &TFIDF Word 2 Vec to process Text data combining with Decision Tree Classifier to predict probability of a project proposal getting approved<br>
