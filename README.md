### [Case Study: Predict Project Approval using Machine Learning and NLP](https://github.com/sandeep-raychaudhuri/Predict-Approval-of-Project-Proposals-on-DonorsChoose)

**Why:**  To determine the future value of a stock or a financial instrument traded (publicly) on an exchange to gain significant profit or avoid losses given efficient-market hypothesis. Although exact price prediction is nearly impossible, but approximaPrte price estimation is possible and can positively impact investor's buying strategy.<br><br>
**How:** Based on 5 year historical data from DonorsChoose.org using TFIDF &TFIDF Word 2 Vec to process Text data combining with Decision Tree Classifier to predict probability of a project proposal getting approved<br>

### [Case Study: Retail Price Optimization]()

**Why:**  Pricing a product is a crucial aspect of any business. A lot of thought process is put into it. There are different strategies to estimate prices for different kinds of products. There are products whose sales are pretty sensitive to their costs, and as such, a slight change in their price can lead to a noticeable difference in their sales. At the same time, there are also products whose sales are not much affected by their worth - these tend to be luxury items or necessities (like certain medicines). 

Price elasticity of demand (EPD), or elasticity, is the degree to which the compelling desire for something changes as its price changes. In general, people desire things less as those things become more expensive. However, for some products, the customersâ€™ desire could drop sharply even with a bit of price increase, and for other products, it could stay almost the same even with a hefty price increase. Economists use the term elasticity to denote this sensitivity of sales to price fluctuations. More precisely, price elasticity gives the percentage change in quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, holding everything else constant.<br><br>
**How:** In this machine learning pricing optimization case study, we will take the data of a cafe and, based on their past sales, identify the optimal prices for their items based on the price elasticity of the items. First, we will calculate the price elasticity for each item, then figure out the optimal price. While taking a particular cafe data, one can extend this work to price any product. This machine learning retail price optimization project will focus on the former products<br>
